# PyTorch Daily Practice 

This repository documents my daily progress as I learn and build with **PyTorch**, exploring core deep learning concepts.
This repo serves as a hands-on learning journal and will be covering everything from tensors and autograd to neural networks and beyond.

## What’s Inside

| Day | Topic Covered | Description |
|-----|---------------|-------------|
| 1   | Tensors       | Creation, indexing, operations, reshaping |


This contains relevant `.ipynb` files along with my notes and experiments.

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.x  
- PyTorch  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google colab 
- NumPy (where needed)

## Learning Focus

- Tensors & operations  
- Automatic differentiation (autograd)  
- Neural network architecture basics  
- Training loops, optimizers, loss functions  
- CNNs, RNNs, and model evaluation *(coming soon)*
