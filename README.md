# PyTorch Daily Practice 

This repository documents my daily progress as I learn and build with **PyTorch**, exploring core deep learning concepts.
This repo serves as a hands-on learning journal and will be covering everything from tensors and autograd to neural networks and beyond.

## What’s Inside

| Day | Topic Covered | Description |
|-----|---------------|-------------|
| 1   | Tensors       | Creation, indexing, operations, reshaping , viewing and stacking ,Squeezing, unsqueezing and permuting |
| 2   | Fundamentals  | PyTorch and NumPy, Reproducibility, Accessing a GPU, Setting up device agnostic code , Exercise Questions |
| 3   | Workflow      | Creating a dataset with linear regression
 Creating training and test sets (the most important concept in ML)
 Creating our first PyTorch model
 Discussing important model building classes
 Checking out the internals of our model
 Making predictions with our model
 Training a model with PyTorch (intuition building)
 Setting up a loss function and optimizer
 PyTorch training loop intuition
 Running our training loop epoch by epoch
 Writing testing loop code
 Saving/loading a model
 Putting everything together |
